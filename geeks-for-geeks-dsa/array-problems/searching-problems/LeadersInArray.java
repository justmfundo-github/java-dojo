 * Write a program to print all the Leaders in the array. An element is a Leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side.
 * Input: arr[] = {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}
 * Output: 17 5 2
 * Explanation: 17 is greater than all the elements to its right: 4, 3, 5 and 2, therefore 17 is a leader.
 * 5 is greater than all the elements to its right: 2, therefore 5 is a leader.
 * 2 has no element to its right, therefore 2 is a leader.

  * The inner loop compares the picked element to all the elements on its right side. If the picked element is greater than all
